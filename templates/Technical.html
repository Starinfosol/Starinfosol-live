                                    a building. But as a contractor, we see buildings differently.
                                    Building elements like the structure, walls, floors, and roof
                                    are all telling of a building’s class. If you don’t already have
                                    a keen eye for those details, it’s important to know the five types
                                    of building <strong>construction</strong>. Especially if you’re in the fire

                                    construction: fire-resistive, non-combustible, ordinary, heavy timber,
                                    and wood-framed.
